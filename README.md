# mkdocs-material-template
- The work of this project is to apply mkdocs-material to write learning materials for the Business Information Technology (BIT) and Computer Applications (CA) at HÃ¤me University of Applied Sciences (HAMK).  
- The need for a template that supports search, code highlight, code copy etc. to replace the old, unsupported template used for several years (earlier than May 2024).  
- Some unmet needs still remain, such as the code highlighting for `bash` and some other languages. But the problem is at `pygments` and not `mkdocs-material`.
